## Beyond the standard Cox model

Today’s sessions explored the options available when the standard semi-parametric assumptions are no longer sufficient for our research goals. We addressed four primary questions:

1.  What are our options if Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) assumption is violated?

2.  How can joint modelling improve upon standard Cox modelling for time-varying covariates?

3.  How can parametric survival models complement Cox modelling (estimating the baseline hazard)?

4.  How can flexible parametric survival models bridge the gap between standard parametric models and semi-parametric Cox model?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. When the 'Standard' Cox Model is Not Enough

While the Cox model is robust because it does not require specifying the baseline hazard, its validity relies heavily on the **proportional hazards (PH) assumption** — the requirement that hazards remain constant over time.

### Strategies for PH Violation

When proportionality fails, we have several structural alternatives:

-   **Stratification:** Useful when a categorical variable (e.g., donor type) strongly affects risk, but you do not need to report its explicit hazard ratio

-   **Time-Varying Effects:** Essential when the *impact* of a covariate (e.g., treatment) changes over follow-up.

-   **Extended Cox Model:** Necessary when a covariate’s actual *value* changes over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Beyond External Predictors with Joint Modelling

Standard survival models assume that time-varying covariates are "external". However, in clinical research, many biomarkers (like eGFR) are **internal** — they predict the event (graft failure) while simultaneously being affected by the disease process itself.

### Benefits of Joint Models

**Joint models** reduce bias by simultaneously modelling the longitudinal trajectory (e.g., linear mixed-effects model for eGFR) and the time-to-event outcome (e.g., Cox model for graft failure)

-   **Addresses bias from internal time-dependent covariates:** Explicitly accounts for the feedback loop between the biomarker and the event.

-   **Measurement Error:** Accounts for the inherent noise in repeated measurements

-   **Precision:** Leads to improved statistical precision and more efficient inference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Beyond the Hazard Ratio with parametric Models

-   The **unspecified baseline hazard** in a Cox model is a "double-edged sword". It avoids wrong assumptions about the shape of risk, but it prevents us from calculating **absolute risks**.

-   Parametric models fully specify the hazard and survival functions, including the baseline hazard, and therefore they allow for the estimation of **absolute risks** and the ability to **extrapolate** survival beyond the observed data

-   It is very important to make sure that the **distributional assumptions** hold — if they do, parametric models offer improved precision compared to semi-parametric models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Flexible Parametric Models: The Best of Both Worlds

-   Flexible parametric models (such as the Royston-Parmar model) provide the **flexibility** of a Cox model combined with the **analytical power** of parametric models

    -   They provide hazard ratios while also allowing for absolute risk measures and extrapolation

-   By using (restricted cubic) splines, these models can capture complex, non-monotonic hazard functions

-   If the PH assumption is violated, time-dependent effects can be easily integrated into the spline framework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary Comparison

| Model Type | Best Used When... | Key Advantage |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Stratified Cox** | PH is violated for a non-primary covariate | No baseline assumption needed |
| **Joint Model** | Dealing with internal biomarkers like eGFR | Accounts for measurement error and feedback |
| **Parametric** | Absolute risks or extrapolation are required | Continuous, smooth hazard functions |
| **Flexible Parametric** | Hazards are complex or PH assumption fails | Bridges the gap between Cox and Parametric |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tomorrow: Beyond binary outcomes

-   What if people are removed from the risk set due to reasons other than the event of interest or uninformative censoring (**competing risks**)?

-   How can **flexible parametric approaches** improve standard modelling of competing risks?

-   What if people experience **semi-competing risks** or **intermediate events** that do not preclude the primary event but may change the risk of the primary event (**multi-state modelling**)?
