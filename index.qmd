Her expertise lies in establishing data linkage studies and using these to apply advanced statistical models to understand patient journeys and complex clinical scenarios. Her work has broadly aimed to improve health service quality and efficiency to translate into better and more equitable patient outcomes. She has a special interest in multi-state modelling and competing risks models. |

She is passionate about transforming complex statistical concepts into clear, practical insights and designing interactive learning experiences that help postgraduate students apply biostatistics confidently in real-world health research. Her research focuses on survival analysis, causal inference, and chronic kidney disease, collaborating with clinicians and multidisciplinary teams to improve patient outcomes. |
